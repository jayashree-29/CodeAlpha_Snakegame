# Snake Game in Python

![Snake Game Demo](snake_game_demo.gif)

## Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library. The game allows the player to control a snake, eat food, and grow in length while avoiding collisions with the boundaries of the game screen and the snake's own body.

## Features

- **Snake Control**: Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction (up, down, left, right).
- **Scoring**: Earn points by eating food items that appear on the screen.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself, displaying a "Game Over" message.
- **Customizable**: You can easily customize the game by modifying variables in the code, such as screen size, snake speed, and more.
- **Simple User Interface**: The game features a basic graphical user interface using Pygame.
